# Test Automation Proposal For Demoblaze e-commerce Platform

This document will provide a test automation strategy for the Demoblaze e-commerce platform.


# Goals & Objectives of Automation

The ultimate goal of test automation is to maintain quick but quality deliveries. The time to market new features will be crucial without compromising the stability and quality of the platform. Maintain test automation practice to have a better user experience of the e-commerce platform both in functional and non-functional aspects. 

The main objective is to have a stable automated test suite for regressions. If the application is more mature and has many regression test cases, prioritizing and selecting these cases for automation is essential. More focus should be on E2E user journeys that may validate the core functionalities covering multiple components. Need to keep adding automated tests for the suite with any new development of features.

Another objective is to have automated smoke or sanity test suites (Subset of regression) which will be helpful in build verifications.

The further objective is to use automation for non-function testing. Tracking and validating performance measures with UL flows will highlight platform performance risks associated with any new architectural or technological changes.


# Tools & Framework to Choose

Playwright is a better choice for the eCommerce application testing 

1. Cross-browser Testing: It is important to ensure that your eCommerce application works consistently across different platforms. Playwright supports testing across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
